1. More than 80% of the total customers in Citi Bike NY are in the goup of "Suscriber". So the big amount of their users are frecuent and also loyal customers.
2. In general the trip duration using bike have increase in the last years. It is a good sign because it means that customers are spending more time with bikes. 
3. We can see that Manhatan is the place that have more user of bikes also we can see that in general the places that users starts their trip is the same as that one where they end. So in terms of logistic it could be a good advice.
